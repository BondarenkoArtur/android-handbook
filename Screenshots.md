A lot of times you will take a quick screenshot of something you work on and share it with your colleagues or client. In order to keep those screenshots on our secure servers you will get an FTP account. If you don’t have

The easiest way to share those images is with one of these two applications:

1. [Skitch](https://evernote.com/skitch/)
2. [Monosnap](https://monosnap.com/welcome)

## Setting up Skitch

1. Go to `Skitch` - `Preferences` - `Sharing`
2. Setup your account

![Skitch preferences](/img/skitch_preferences.png "Skitch preferences")

When you take a screenshot you can upload it to FTP by clicking `Share` - `FTP` - `FTP YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME`.

## Setting up Monosnap

1. Go to `Preferences` - `Account` - `FTP`
2. Set up your account

![Monosnap preferences](/img/monosnap_preferences.png "Monosnap preferences")

When you take a screenshot you can upload it to FTP by clicking on `Upload` button.

## Which one to use?

Both Monosnap and Skitch will automatically save the link to your clipboard when you upload the screenshot to ftp and both work very well. It’s up to you to choose the tool you will use.
